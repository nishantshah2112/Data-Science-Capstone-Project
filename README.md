# Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the dataset and trained model for predicting car selling prices.

## Contents

- `best_model.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model.
- `CAR DETAILS.csv`: Dataset.
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for predictions.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the selling prices of cars using various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: The dataset `CAR DETAILS.csv` includes detailed information about various cars.
2. **Trained Model**: The `best_model.pkl` is the trained Random Forest model used for making predictions.
3. **Application**: The `app.py` file is a Streamlit app that allows users to input car details and get predicted selling prices.
